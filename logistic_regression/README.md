### Important Note on Logistic Regression
While this project is titled "Logistic Regression," it's crucial to understand that machine learning projects focused on logistic regression are essentially classification tasks. These projects aim to categorize data into a specific number of nominal categories. This categorization is achieved by training a neural network that learns autonomously and subsequently predicts the category to which each dataset belongs. Despite its name, logistic regression is fundamentally about selection and classification rather than traditional regression.
